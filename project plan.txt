# use transfer learning from MobileNetV2

# resize all the images to preserve aspect ratio so that the information within the images is not lost
- to resize image you can use Python Imaging Library (PIL) or other image processing libraries before using them with ImageDataGenerator

# implement custom callbacks
- the custom callbacks criteria are : 
1. stop when model acc & val_acc are above 92%
2. stop when model acc & val_acc are not improving within decided epochs
3. stop when model loss & val_loss are not improving within decided epochs
4. stop when model loss & val_loss are above 80% within decided epochs
